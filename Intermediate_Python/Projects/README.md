Here are the final projects of the course:

Fibonacci ->


		A series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

		Steps:

		    Define a function that allows the user to find the value of the nth term in the sequence.

		    To make sure you've written your function correctly, test the first 10 numbers of the sequence.

		    You can assume either that the first two terms are 0 and 1 or that they are both 1.

		    There are two methods you can employ to solve the problem. One way is to solve it using a loop and the other way is to use recursion.

		    Try implementing a solution using both methods.
