The programs here are from the course:

Here are the final projects of the course:

Fibonacci ->


		A series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

		Steps:

		    Define a function that allows the user to find the value of the nth term in the sequence.

		    To make sure you've written your function correctly, test the first 10 numbers of the sequence.

		    You can assume either that the first two terms are 0 and 1 or that they are both 1.

		    There are two methods you can employ to solve the problem. One way is to solve it using a loop and the other way is to use recursion.

		    Try implementing a solution using both methods.
		    
		    

Mini_Story ->



		Mad Libs Story Maker

		"Mad Libs consist of a book that has a short story on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a lexical or other category, such as "noun," "verb," "place," or "part of the body." One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute some word for the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical."

		Steps:

		    Create a Mad Libs style game, where the program asks the user for certain types of words, and then prints out a story with the words that the user inputted.

		    The story doesn't have to be too long, but it should have some sort of story line.

		    Tip: it's easiest to write out a quick story on a piece of paper or a word document, and then go back through and see which words the user should be able to change.

		    Subgoals:

        If the user has to put in a name, change the first letter to a capital letter.

        Change the word "a" to "an" when the next word in the sentence begins with a vowel.
